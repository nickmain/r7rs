The symbol `==>` used in program examples is read “evaluates to.” For example

``` scheme
(* 5 8)    ==> 40
```

means that the expression `(* 5 8)` evaluates to the object `40`. 

Or, more precisely, the expression given by the sequence of characters `(* 5 8)` evaluates, in an environment containing the base library, to an object that can be represented externally by the sequence of characters `40`. 

See [[External Representations]] for a discussion of external representations of objects.
