Pre-Scheme was originally created as part of the [Scheme48](https://s48.org) project as a way to generate the virtual machine from source code written in a sub-set of Scheme.

There is an active project to modernize Pre-Scheme and allow it to run on top of other R7RS compatible implementations: [prescheme.org](https://prescheme.org)
